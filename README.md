The repo contains my code that helped me clear the NVIDIA Deep Learning Fundamentals.  
Please Visit NVIDIA DLI for more suchevents!!

The code is actually for the rotten fruits dataset at kaggle. NVIDIA cloud compute though provides 
a very good, and fast resource to complete the lab which would had otherwise taken a lot of time.
